# Credit_Risk_Analysis

"01_Simple_Logistic_Regression.ipynb": This notebook uses simple logistic regression to predict credit risk. The notebook includes data preparation and visualization steps, as well as model training and evaluation.
"02_SmoteENN.ipynb": This notebook uses a combination of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN) to balance the imbalanced dataset and improve model performance.
"03_Ensemble_Learning.ipynb": This notebook explores ensemble learning techniques, including Random Oversampling, SMOTE Oversampling, Cluster Centroids Undersampling, and a combination of SMOTE and Random Undersampling. The notebook also includes evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, classification report, and balanced accuracy score.
"04_Credit_Risk_Ensemble.ipynb": This notebook uses a combination of Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier to predict credit risk. The notebook includes model training, evaluation, and comparison with the previous algorithms used.
"credit_risk_resampling_starter_code.ipynb": This notebook is a starter code for the credit risk resampling challenge, which requires students to implement various resampling techniques to improve the accuracy of the credit risk model.
